Installing under Linux should be a snap if you have a working version of
gcc  and  its libraries installed. ftpbackup of course, relies on TCP/IP
communications.


You  can  just  proceed  and do 'make' if the following assumptions hold
true in your case:

	- Makefile assumes the following directories:

		/usr/local/bin		for binary ftpbackup
		/usr/local/man/man1	for ftpbackup.1 man page
		/usr/local/doc		for ftpbackup.lsm doc.

	- That you're compiling with optimization (and not debug)

If the above are TRUE, then you should be able to just perform:

	1. 'make'

	2. 'su root'

	3. 'make install'


Otherwise, edit the Makefile and recompile:

	1. Edit Makefile to suit

	2. 'make distclean' to remove vestiges of last make

	3. 'make'

	4. Repeat with #1 as necessary


Non GNU-Enabled Platforms:
--------------------------

For  non  Linux  platforms, you'll want to remove the -DHAVE_GETOPT_LONG
option  from  the  makefile,  unless  you  have  the  GNU  getopt_long()
installed  somewhere (if you have that in an unusual place, you may also
need to update the LDOPTS= line).

Most non Linux platforms will also probably need certain libraries added
to  linking  step  in  the  makefile  in  order  to satisfy  the  TCP/IP
networking calls. Do this in the LDOPTS= line.
