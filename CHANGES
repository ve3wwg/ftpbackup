ftpbackup-2.1 Changes				Mon Sep 15 23:09:13 1997

With  the  help  of  Hal Wine <hal@dtor.com>, ftpbackup-2.1 comes to you
with a few small fixes, and a couple of new features.  Additionally, Hal
has been kind enough to provide us a man page as well.

Hal  provided  a patch to me that caused ftpbackup to create a directory
(for backup)  if  it  did not  exist. I have chosen to make this feature
optional and it is enabled with the -D option.

CHANGES:

 - New man page ftpbackup.1 (thanks Hal)
 - New -D option to allow creation of a directory
 - Now supports the venerable --version option (or -V) to display version
   info (Hal's idea)
 - ftpbackup is under RCS control (at my QTH at least)
 - I trimmed the boxy comments in the source, and cleaned up the source code
 - Bad options invoke --help display (Hal)
 - --help info corrections (Hal)
 - READ.ME file corrections (Hal)
 - Makefile overhaul (formerly named 'makefile'). Some of these changes
   were inspired at Hal's suggestion.
 - LSM file fixed and updated

LAST MINUTE CHANGE: 2.0 -> 2.1

 - Placed under the Gnu Public License 2 (GPL2)
